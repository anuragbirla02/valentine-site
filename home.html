        I could’ve sent a message.  
        I could’ve sent flowers.  
        But I wanted to create something that stays — just like what I feel for you.
    </p>

    <p class="fade">
        You walked into my life quietly,
        but somehow changed the loudest parts of it.
        You make ordinary days feel lighter,
        and difficult days feel possible.
    </p>

    <p class="fade">
        I don’t always say things perfectly.
        Sometimes I overthink.
        Sometimes I stay silent.
        But never — not even once —
        have I been unsure about you.

        No matter where life takes us,
        I want you to know —  
        you were chosen.  
        Every single day.

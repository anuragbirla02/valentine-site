        I could've sent a message.  
        I could've sent flowers.  
        But I wanted to create something that stays — just like what I feel for you.

    <p class="message fade" style="margin-left:0%">
    You walked into my life quietly,<br>
    but somehow changed everything.
</p>
    <p class="message fade" style="margin-left:45%">
    You make ordinary days feel lighter,<br>
    and difficult ones feel possible.
</p>
<p class="message fade" style="margin-left:15%">
    I may not say it every day,<br>
    but choosing you is my favourite habit.

    <p class="ending">
        No matter where life takes us,
        I want you to know —  
        you were chosen.  
        Every single day.
